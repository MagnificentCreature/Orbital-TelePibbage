The first row will contain the main headers, ie Colour, Games etc
In each Column there will be sub headers indicated by a starting braces and number, ie (5).
This number indicates its realitve rate (compared to the row), of how often an item inside the column is used.

the (current) 6 columns will be:
Colour, Medium, Photography, Lighting, Descriptor, Film and Games

the sixth option will be from random words which will also favour the player usernames

Once an option is picked from a category, they can no longer pick from that category. (ie if they pick colour, they can no longer pick colour again). A random word will be generated in its place
